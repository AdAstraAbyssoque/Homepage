# About us

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) iGEM team is a student-led synthetic biology research team comprising members from diverse disciplines. Our goal is to promote the safe and open development of engineered biology through participation in the annual International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. We aim to identify real-world problems, design genetic circuits as solutions, and demonstrate proof-of-concept in the lab.
